# Selected Master Program Work

In reviewing some of past course work from my master's program I was pleasantly surprised with the coding work I had completed and thought it was worth sharing and highlighting some of my favorite projects. An idea for the future may be to revisit these same works and topics, to enhance the work have done with new packages, capabilities, and ideas.
